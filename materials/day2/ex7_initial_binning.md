### Remove short contigs from the data set

Ideally, we do not want to be creating bins from all of the assembled contigs, as there is often a long tail of contigs which are only several *k*-mers long. These have little biological meaning, as they are too short for robust gene annotation, and they can introduct a significant degree of noise in the clustering algorithms used for binning. We therefore identify a suitable threshold for a minimum length of contigs to be considered for binning.

We have already done this in the previous exercise](https://github.com/GenomicsAotearoa/metagenomics_summer_school/blob/master/materials/day2/ex5_evaluating_assemblies.md) so we could either use the existing filtering at 1,000 bp in length, or move to something stricter. Most binning tools have a default cut-off for minimum contig size - **MetaBAT** uses a default minimum of 2,500 bp, and recommends at least 1,500. By contrast, **MaxBin** sets the minimum length at 1,000 bp.

### Obtain coverage profiles for assembled contigs via read mapping

Binning is done using a combination of information encoded in the *composition* and *coverage* of the assembled contigs. *Composition* refers to *k*-mer (usually tetranucleotide) frequency profiles of the contigs, which are generally conserved within a genome. By constract, *coverage* is a reflection of the abundance of the contigs in the assembly. Organisms which are more abundant will contribute more genomic material to the metagenome, and hence their DNA will be, on average, more abundant in the sample. When binning, we can look for pieces of DNA which are not assembled together, but have similar *composition* and occur at approximately equal abundances in the sample to identify contigs which likely originate in the same genome.

The composition of the contigs is calculated by the binning tool at run time, but to obtain coverage information we must map our unassembled reads from each sample against the assembly to generate the differential abundance profiles for each contig. This is acheived using **bowtie2** to map the reads against the assembly, then **samtools** to sort and compress the resulting file.

#### Creating a mapping index

Before we can map reads, we need to create a **bowtie2** index file from the assembly, for use in read mapping. Navigate into the *5.binning/* folder to begin.

```bash
module load Bowtie2/2.3.5-GCC-7.4.0

srun bowtie2-build spades_assembly/spades_assembly.m1000.fna spades_assembly/bw_spades
```

If you look inside the *spades_assembly/* folder you will now see the following:

```bash
ls spades_assembly/
# bw_spades.1.bt2  bw_spades.3.bt2  bw_spades.rev.1.bt2  spades_assembly.fna
# bw_spades.2.bt2  bw_spades.4.bt2  bw_spades.rev.2.bt2  spades_assembly.m1000.fna
```

These files ending in *.bt2* are the index files for **bowtie2**, and are specific to this tool. If you wish to map using an alternate tool (for example **bowtie** or **BBMap**) you will need to create index/database files using these programs.

Generally speaking, we don't need to know the names of the index files, as they are simply refered to be the output name we specified (*bw_spades*) when running **bowtie2**.

#### Mapping the reads

We will create a slurm script to perform the mapping steps, as these benefit greatly from the multithreaded capacity of NeSI and we will use a *for loop* to iterate over each set of reads to simplify our script.

The full script is provided here, and we will discuss it below.

```bash
#!/bin/bash -e
#SBATCH -A xxxxx
#SBATCH -J spades_mapping
#SBATCH --partition zzzzz
#SBATCH --time 00:20:00
#SBATCH --mem 20GB
#SBATCH --ntasks 1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task 10
#SBATCH -e spades_mapping.err
#SBATCH -o spades_mapping.out

module load Bowtie2/2.3.5-GCC-7.4.0 SAMtools/1.8-gimkl-2018b

cd 5.binning/

# Step 1
for i in sample1 sample2 sample3 sample4;
do

  # Step 2
  srun bowtie2 --minins 200 --maxins 800 --threads 10 --sensitive \
               -x spades_assembly/bw_spades \
               -1 ../3.assembly/${i}_R1.fastq.gz -2 ../3.assembly/${i}_R2.fastq.gz \
               -S ${i}.sam

  # Step 3
  srun samtools sort -o ${i}.bam ${i}.sam

done
```

#### Step 1 - Loop through the sample files

Since we just want to perform the same set of operations on each file, we can use a *for loop* to repeat each operation on a set of files. The structure of the loop, and use of variables was covered on the first day.

For large sets of files, it can be beneficial to use a slurm *array* to send the jobs out to different nodes and distribute the process across many independent jobs. An example of how we could modify the above script is given at the bottom of this exercise, but is not necessary for the purposes of this workshop.

#### Step 2 - Map the reads using *bowtie2*

This is performed using the following parameters

|Parameter|Function|
|:---|:---|
|**--minins 200**|Minimum insert size, determines the minimum distance between the start of each read pair|
|**--maxins 800**|Maximum insert size, determines the maximum distance between the start of each read pair|
|**--threads 10**|Number of threads to use in read mapping|
|**--sensitive**|Specifies where we want to be positioned in the trade-off between speed and sensitivity. See the manual for more information|
|**-x spades_assembly/bw_spades**|The base name of our assembly index. Should be exactly the same as what was specified when running **bowtie2-build**|
|**-1** / **-2**|The forward and reverse read pairs to map to the assembly|
|**-S**|Name of the output file, to be written in *sam* format|

#### Step 3 - Sorting and compressing results

The default output format for most maping tools is the Sequence Alignment/Map (*sam*) format. This is a compact text representation of where each short read sits in the contigs. You can view this file using any text viewer, although owing to the file size **less** is a good idea.

Generally I wouldn't bother with this - there is a lot of information in here and unless you are looking to extract specific information from the alignment directly, this is just an intermediate file in our workflow. In order to save disk space, and prepare the file for downstream analysis we now perform two final steps:

1. Sort the mapping information
1. Compress the *sam* file into its binary equivalent, *bam

Compressing the file to the *bam* format is an important step as when working with real data *sam* files can be massive and our storage capacity on NeSI is limited. It is also helpful to sort the mapping information to that reads mapped to a contig are listed in order of their start position. For example

```bash
# Unsorted reads
Ref: REFERENCECONTIG
Map: --------ECONT--
Map: REFE-----------
Map: --FERENCECO----
Map: -----------NTIG

# Sorted reads
Ref: REFERENCECONTIG
Map: REFE-----------
Map: --FERENCECO----
Map: --------ECONT--
Map: -----------NTIG
```

Reads will almost certianly be mapped in a random order as they are added to the *sam* file more or less in the order that they are encountered in the original *fastQ* files.

Sorting the mapping information is an important prerequisite for performing certain downstream processes. Not every tool we use requires reads to be sorted, but it can be frustrating having to debug the instances where read sorting matters so we typically just get it done as soon as possible and then we don't have to worry about it again.

In newer versions of **samtools** we can perform the sorting and compressing in a single operation (as shown in the script above). For older versions of **samtools**, you may need to use a command of the following form.

```bash
samtools view -bS sample1.sam | samtools sort -o sample1.bam
```

### Create initial bins using *MetaBAT* and *MaxBin*

With this mapping information, we can now perform binning. There are a multitude of good binning tools current published, and each have their strengths and weaknesses. As there is no clear best tool for binning, the current strategy for binning is to use a number of different binning tools on your data, then use the tool **DAS_Tool** to evaluate all potential outcomes and define the best set of bins across all tools used.

In our own workflow, we use the tools **MetaBAT**, **MaxBin**, and **CONCOCT** for binning but there are many alternatives that are equally viable. In the interests of time here, we are only going to demonstrate the first two tools.

#### Binning using *MetaBAT*

**MetaBAT** binning occurs in two steps. First, the *bam* files are parsed into a tab-delimited table of the average coverage depth and variance per sample mapped. Binning is then performed using this table. To obtain the depth table, **MetaBAT** comes bundled with the auxillary tool **jgi_summarize_bam_contig_depths**. This tool takes as many *bam* files as we are able to give it, and summarises the mapping information into a single text file. We can either specify the *bam* files individually, or use wildcards as shown below

```bash
module load MetaBAT/2.13-GCC-7.4.0

# Manual specification of files
jgi_summarize_bam_contig_depths --outputDepth metabat.txt sample1.bam sample2.bam sample3.bam sample4.bam

# Wildcard
jgi_summarize_bam_contig_depths --outputDepth metabat.txt sample*.bam
```

Both give the same result. We can then pass the table *metabat.txt* into the **MetaBAT** binning tool.

```bash
metabat2 -t 10 -m 1500 -i spades_assembly/spades_assembly.m1000.fna -a metabat.txt -o metabat/metabat
```

Note here that we are specifying a minimum contig size of 1,500 bp, which the limit allowed by the authors of **MetaBAT**. This larger than our minimum when filtering the assembly which means there are some assembled contigs which cannot be binned. Consider the choice of this parameter and your initial contig filtering carefully when binning your own data.

When specifying the output file, notice that we pass both a folder path (*metabat/*) and file name (*metabat*). The reason I do this is that **MetaBAT** writes its output files using the pattern

```bash
[USER VALUE].[BIN NUMBER].fa
```

The problem with this is that on Linux systems, prefixing a file or folder name with a '.' character means the the file is hidden. This can lead to a lot of confusion when your binning job compeltes sucessfully but no files are visible!

#### Binning using *MaxBin*

Like **MetaBAT**, **MaxBin** requires a text representation of the coverage information for binning. Luckily, we can be sneaky here and just reformat the *metabat.txt* file into the format expected by **MaxBin**. We use **cut** to select only the columns of interest, which are the *contigName* and coverage columns, but not the *contigLen*, *totalAvgDepth*, or variance columns.

We can inspect the *metabat.txt* file with **head** or **less** to identify the correct column indices for **cut**.

```bash
less metabat.txt

cut -f1,4,6,8,10 metabat.txt > maxbin.txt
```

This table is then passed to **MaxBin**. Unlike the case with **MetaBAT**, if we want to direct the output files into a folder, we must create that folder in advance.

```bash
module load MaxBin/2.2.6-gimkl-2018b-Perl-5.28.1

mkdir -p maxbin/
run_MaxBin.pl -thread 10 -min_contig_length 1500 -contig spades_assembly/spades_assembly.m1000.fna -abund maxbin.txt -out maxbin/maxbin
```

This will take a bit longer to complete, as **MaxBin** uses gene prediction tools to identify the ideal contigs to use as the start of each bin.
